# ReqLite
A VERY lightweight and user-friendly CLI to test HTTP/HTTPS APIs in a fast manner.

Not to be confused with [`ReQl`](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/introduction-to-reql/) or [`reql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reql).

# Features:
1. Quick request management: CURL power with a user-friendly approach.
2. Save secrets locally: `.env`-like secret storing.
3. Import/export request collections.
4. Save and run request templates.

# Commands
